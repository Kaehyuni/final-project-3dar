  <h1>3D / AR Lab</h1>
  <p class="hero-text">
    This page is a hands-on space where you can scan a QR code and view biology models in 3D and augmented reality.
    The goal is to make biology feel visual, interactive, and easier to understand.
  </p>
</header>

<!-- What You Will Do -->
<section class="about">
  <h2>What You Will Do Here</h2>
  <p>
    You will choose a model, scan the QR code, and open the model on your device.
    Each model includes a short description of what to look for, along with study prompts to guide your learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    These models are meant to support topics commonly covered in introductory biology, including cell structure,
    membrane transport, and protein related structures. New models will be added as the project grows.

<!-- How to Use -->
<section class="using-ar">
  <h2>How to Use the AR Lab</h2>
  <p>
    Follow these steps for the best experience:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a model from the gallery below.</li>
    <li>Scan the QR code using your camera app.</li>
    <li>Open the model link in your browser.</li>
    <li>Use pinch to zoom, drag to rotate, and explore the structure.</li>
    <li>If your device supports AR, select the AR option when available.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Tip: Make sure you are in a well lit area if you are using AR, and move your camera slowly so the device can detect the environment.

      <h3>iPhone and iPad</h3>
      <p>
        Most modern iPhones and iPads support AR. Use the camera app to scan the QR code.
        If the model opens in a viewer that offers AR, select the AR option and follow the on screen instructions.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Android Phones</h3>
      <p>
        Many Android devices support AR, but it depends on the model and settings.
        Scan the QR code, open the link, and look for an AR option if it is provided by the viewer.

      <h3>Cell Model</h3>
      <p>
        Focus on major organelles and how each structure supports the cell’s function.
        Try identifying the nucleus, mitochondria, and cell membrane.
