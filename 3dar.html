  <h1>3D / AR Lab</h1>
  <p class="hero-text">
    This page is a hands-on space where you can scan a QR code and view biology models in 3D and augmented reality.
    The goal is to make biology feel visual, interactive, and easier to understand.
  </p>
</header>

<!-- What You Will Do -->
<section class="about">
  <h2>What You Will Do Here</h2>
  <p>
    You will choose a model, scan the QR code, and open the model on your device.
    Each model includes a short description of what to look for, along with study prompts to guide your learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    These models are meant to support topics commonly covered in introductory biology, including cell structure,
    membrane transport, and protein related structures. New models will be added as the project grows.

<!-- How to Use -->
<section class="inspiration">
  <h2>How to Use the AR Lab</h2>
  <p>
    Follow these steps for the best experience:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a model from the gallery below.</li>
    <li>Scan the QR code using your camera app.</li>
    <li>Open the model link in your browser.</li>
    <li>Use pinch to zoom, drag to rotate, and explore the structure.</li>
    <li>If your device supports AR, select the AR option when available.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Tip: Make sure you are in a well lit area if you are using AR, and move your camera slowly so the device can detect the environment.
