    <h1>Biology Made Visual</h1>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Hi, I’m <strong>Kenny Nguyen</strong>, a <strong>Biology Tutor & Academic Coach</strong> at
      Dallas College Richland Campus Learning Commons.  
      BioBridge uses visual learning and augmented reality to help students truly understand biology not only just memorize it.

  <section class="about">
    <h2>About BioBridge</h2>
    <p>
      Many students struggle with biology because it is often taught through dense textbooks
      and static diagrams. BioBridge was created to change that experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Biology Tutor and Academic Coach, I work one-on-one with students to break down complex
      topics like cell structure, membrane transport, and protein synthesis using
      visual explanations and interactive tools. I can see how it is atmost difficult for student to 
	  engage and learn when they are glued to long straining of information all at once. Especially when it comes
	  exploring information from the textbooks and lecture powerpoint. It is harder for them to digest information. 
	  To make it easier for them, I want to share my experience when it comes to finding resources, a 3D augmented 
	  reality where they can interact, and amazing resources such as visual representation in videos. 
	  I beleive that education can be represented as something interactive. Especially when it stucked with me when I was student. 
	  I hope my animations and 3D modeling can help bring a brigde to education in Biology.

  <!-- Inspiration Section -->
  <section class="inspiration">
    <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      My passion for visual learning began in 7th grade with my science teacher,
      <strong>Mr. Andy Thomason</strong>. He introduced our class to augmented reality as a way
      to explore scientific concepts beyond the textbook.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Seeing biology through AR made makes the representation feel way more interactive. We weren’t just reading about cells
      we were exploring them.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That experience shaped how I support students today. BioBridge continues that same philosophy:
      learning is most effective when students can see, explore, and interact with what they study.
