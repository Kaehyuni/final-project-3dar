    <h1>Biology Made Visual</h1>
    <p class="hero-text">
      Hi, I’m <strong>Kenny Nguyen</strong>, a <strong>Biology Tutor & Academic Coach</strong> at
      Dallas College Richland Campus Learning Commons.  
      BioBridge uses visual learning and augmented reality to help students truly understand biology —
      not just memorize it.

    <h2>About BioBridge</h2>
    <p>
      Many students struggle with biology because it is often taught through dense textbooks
      and static diagrams. BioBridge was created to change that experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Biology Tutor and Academic Coach, I work one-on-one with students to break down complex
      topics like cell structure, membrane transport, and protein synthesis using
      visual explanations and interactive tools.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
      My passion for visual learning began in 7th grade with my science teacher,
      <strong>Mr. Andy Thomason</strong>. He introduced our class to augmented reality as a way
      to explore scientific concepts beyond the textbook.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Seeing biology through AR made abstract ideas feel real. We weren’t just reading about cells —
      we were exploring them.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That experience shaped how I support students today. BioBridge continues that same philosophy:
      learning is most effective when students can see, explore, and interact with what they study.
